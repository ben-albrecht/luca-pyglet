luca
====
Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA)
Microbial Life Simulator

This program was fully developed in Vim

Written in Python with the following libraries:
Pyglet (multimedia Python library) 
math (self-explanatory)
Tkinter (window sizing)
sys (determine OS)

Version 1.0 - Basic simulation
==============================
This version will be abandoned after I sufficiently clean it up.
This project will continue in a separate repository with a 
game engine (Cocos2d-python, built on top of Pyglet) instead 
of a multimedia library (Pyglet)
